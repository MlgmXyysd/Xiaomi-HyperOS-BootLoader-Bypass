## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

After unlocking the BootLoader, you may encounter the following situations:

- Software or hardware not working properly or even damaged.
- Loss of data stored in the device.
- Credit card theft, or other financial loss.

If you're experiencing any of the above, you should take all the responsibility yourself as this is the risk you may encounter when unlocking BootLoader. This obviously does not cover all risks. You've been warned.

- Warranty lost. Not only the base warranty, but some of the extra extended warranties (such as Mi Care or broken-screen warranty) that you have purchased may also be lost according to the exclusions provided by Xiaomi.
- Hardware level self-destruct like Samsung Knox. TEE-related features will be permanently damaged. There is no way to restore other than by replacing the motherboard.
- Functional anomalies after flashing a third-party system due to closed-source kernel source code.
- Device or account banned by unlocking BootLoader.

If you're experiencing any of the above, consider yourself damned. Ever since Xiaomi restricted unlocking BootLoader, it has been against Xiaomi's 'geek' spirit and even the GPL. Xiaomi's restrictions on BootLoader unlocking are endless, and there's nothing we as developers can do about it.

## üì≤ Unlocking requirements

- An valid device:
  - A unbanned\* Xiaomi, Redmi or POCO device.

- An valid SIM card:
  - \* Except for tablets that cannot use SIM cards.
  - SIM card must not be out of service.
  - SIM card needs to be able to access the internet.
  - Only 2 devices per valid SIM card are allowed to be unlock to a valid SIM card within a three-month period.
- An valid Xiaomi account:
  - A unbanned\* Xiaomi account.
  - Each account can only unlock 1 phone in a month and 3 phones in a year period.
- You have read and understood the [Warning](#%EF%B8%8F-warning) above.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to use

1. Download and install PHP 8.0+ for your system from the [official website](https://www.php.net/downloads).
2. Enable OpenSSL and Curl extension in `php.ini`. (And/or set `extension_dir` to your PHP's `ext` directory if script not work.)
3. Place `adb.php` in [php-adb](https://github.com/MlgmXyysd/php-adb) to the directory.
4. Download [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools) and place them in `libraries`. *Note: Mac OS needs to rename `adb` to `adb-darwin`.*
5. Open a terminal and use PHP interpreter to execute the [script](../bypass.php).

- p.s. Releases has packaged the required files and click-to-run scripts.

6. Tap repeatedly on the `Settings - About Phone - MIUI Version` to enable `Development Options`.
7. Enable `OEM Unlocking`, `USB Debugging` and `USB Debugging (Security Settings)` in `Settings - Additional Settings - Development Options`.
8. Log in an _valid_\* Xiaomi account.
9. Connect phone to PC via wired interface.
10. Check `Always allow from this computer` and click `OK`.

- \* See "[Unlocking Requirements](#-Unlocking-requirements)" above.

11. Wait and follow the prompts of script.
12. After successful binding, you can use the [official unlock tool](https://en.miui.com/unlock/index.html) to check the time you need to wait.
13. During the waiting period, please use the device normally, keep the SIM card inserted, do not log out of your account or turn off `Find My Phone`, and do not re-bind the device until it is successfully unlocked. The device will automatically send `HeartBeat` packets to the server every once in a while.

## üîñ FAQs

- **Q: Binding failed with error code `10000`.**
  - A: Xiaomi has changed the encryption method from AES only encryption to RSA+AES hybrid encryption in the new version of settings APP. To solve this issue, you can try downgrading the settings app to an [old version](https://github.com/MlgmXyysd/Xiaomi-HyperOS-BootLoader-Bypass/releases/tag/1.0-fix). For further information, please refer to [here](https://twitter.com/realMlgmXyysd/status/1748386904050110675).

- **Q: Binding failed with error code `30003`.**
  - A: Some product series DO NOT SUPPORT unlocking (e.g. Redmi Note 13/13 Pro/13 Pro+) according to Xiaomi's current unlocking policy. You'll get the same maintenance tips whether your device is running HyperOS or MIUI on these devices, and there is NO SOLUTION AVAILABLE for this issue.

- **Q: Binding failed with error code `30001`.**
  - A: Your device has been forced to verify the account qualification by Xiaomi. Xiaomi lost its 'geek' spirit a long time ago, and there's nothing we can do about it.

- Q: Why does the unlock tool still remind me to wait 168/360 (or more) hours?
  - A: By principle, this PoC only bypasses the restrictions added for HyperOS. You still need to comply with the restrictions for MIUI.

- Q: The device shows `Couldn't verify, wait a minute or two and try again`.
  - A: This is normal, the binding request on the device side has been blocked by our script. The actual binding result is subject to the script prompt.

- Q: Binding failed with error code `401`.
  - A: Your Xiaomi account credentials have expired, you need to log out and log in again in your device.

- Q: Binding failed with error code `20086`.
  - A: Your device credentials have expired, you need to reboot your device.

- Q: Binding failed with error code `20090` or `20091`.
  - A: Device's Security Device Credential Manager function failure, contact after-sales.

- Q: Binding failed with error code `86015`.
  - A: The server has rejected this bind request, please try again.
